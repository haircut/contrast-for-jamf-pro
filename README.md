# contrast-for-jamf-pro
A custom style sheet to increase contrast and legibility in Jamf Pro 10+

Because my eyesight isn't what it used to be...

This is a community-sourced project for Jamf Pro administrators to contribute
their favorite tweaks for the Jamf Pro GUI.

## Usage
1. Install the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) extension (or Stylish)
2. Add stylesheet for your Jamf Pro server
3. Copy the rules in `jamfpro.css` to your Jamf Pro Stylus stylesheet

Better docs forthcoming.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, add your tweaks, then open a PR!

## Purpose

The purpose of this stylesheet is to increase **legibility** and **contrast**
within the Jamf Pro GUI. The intent is not to "brand" or "theme" the interface
for your organization.
